Week 1: Data Analytics Foundations
Overview

This week focused on building a strong understanding of the fundamentals of data analytics. The goal was to understand what data analysis is, how analysts think, and how business problems are translated into data-driven insights.

What I Learned
Data Analysis

Data analysis is a structured process used to gain insights from data. The process typically involves:

- Defining the objective

- Collecting data

- Cleaning data

- Analyzing data

- Interpreting results

- Communicating insights to stakeholders

Types of Data Analysis

- Descriptive: What happened

- Diagnostic: Why it happened

- Predictive: What is likely to happen

- Prescriptive: What action should be taken

Business Questions vs Data Questions

Business questions focus on understanding a business challenge or opportunity.

Data questions translate those challenges into measurable, data-driven investigations that uncover patterns, trends, or root causes.

KPIs and Metrics

Metrics measure performance, but KPIs are the metrics that matter most for a specific business goal.

Key takeaway:

Before analyzing any dataset, identify which metric truly matters for the business objective.

Practical Exposure

For hands-on practice, I explored a sales and marketing dataset (CSV) from Kaggle.

Each row represented a sales record

Columns captured customer and sales-related attributes

Business Question Identified:

How are sales trending over time?

This question will be explored further in subsequent practicals.

Key Reflection

The highlight of this week was learning how crucial context is in data analysis. Context turns data into actionable insights, prevents misleading conclusions, and supports better decision-making.

Next Steps

In Week 2, I will be exploring Excel for Data Analysis, including:

- Data cleaning

- Formulas and functions

- Pivot tables

- Basic dashboards
